    <p><strong>Classic Spaghetti Carbonara</strong></p>
    <p>
      <em>Spaghetti Carbonara</em> is a rich and creamy Italian pasta dish made
      with just a few simple ingredients. The key to an authentic Carbonara is
      using high-quality eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, crispy pancetta, and
      freshly cracked black pepper. The pasta is cooked to al dente and then
      tossed with a silky sauce made from eggs and cheese, which is gently
      heated by the warmth of the pasta, creating a smooth, creamy coating
      without the need for heavy cream.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>12 oz (340g) spaghetti</li>
      <li>4 oz (115g) pancetta or bacon, diced</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup Pecorino Romano cheese, grated</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente.
        Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet, cook the diced pancetta over medium heat until
        crispy. Remove the pancetta from the skillet and set aside, leaving the
        rendered fat in the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, and black
        pepper until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the rendered pancetta fat
        and toss to coat. Remove the skillet from the heat and quickly stir in
        the egg and cheese mixture, tossing the pasta continuously to create a
        creamy sauce. The residual heat from the pasta will cook the eggs and
        melt the cheese, creating a smooth and creamy sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the crispy pancetta back to the skillet and toss to combine. Serve
        the Spaghetti Carbonara hot with additional Pecorino Romano cheese and
        black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enjoy your delicious homemade Spaghetti Carbonara with a side of garlic
        bread and a fresh green salad.
