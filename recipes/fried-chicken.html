    <p><strong>Classic Fried Chicken</strong></p>
    <p>
      A <em>classic fried chicken</em> recipe starts with juicy, well-seasoned
      chicken pieces marinated in buttermilk to ensure tenderness and flavor.
      The chicken is then coated in a seasoned flour mixture, which typically
      includes salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and a touch of cayenne for
      heat. This coating creates the crispy, golden-brown crust that makes fried
      chicken so irresistible. For the best results, the chicken should be fried
      in hot oil at around 350°F (175°C) until it’s perfectly cooked and crispy
      on the outside while remaining juicy inside.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 lbs (900g) chicken pieces (legs, thighs, wings, or breasts)</li>
      <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces, buttermilk, salt, pepper,
        garlic powder, and onion powder. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4
        hours or overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic
        powder, and cayenne. Remove the chicken from the buttermilk marinade and
        dredge each piece in the seasoned flour mixture, shaking off any excess.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven to 350°F (175°C). Working
        in batches, fry the chicken pieces for 6-8 minutes per side or until
        golden brown and cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the chicken from the oil and place it on a wire rack set over a
        baking sheet to drain. Serve the fried chicken hot, warm, or at room
        temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enjoy your delicious homemade fried chicken with your favorite sides
        like mashed potatoes, coleslaw, cornbread, or biscuits.
