    <p><strong>Garlic Butter Steak</strong></p>
    <p>
      A perfectly <em>cooked steak with a rich garlic butter</em> sauce is a
      timeless dish that highlights the natural flavors of high-quality beef.
      The key to a great steak is selecting a well-marbled cut like ribeye,
      filet mignon, or New York strip and cooking it over high heat to create a
      beautiful crust. The steak is seared in a hot pan with butter, garlic, and
      fresh herbs, infusing it with a deep, savory flavor.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ribeye or New York strip steaks (about 1 inch thick)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Remove the steaks from the refrigerator and let them sit at room
        temperature for 30 minutes to an hour. This will help them cook more
        evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the steaks generously with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat a
        large skillet over high heat and add the olive oil. Once the skillet is
        hot, add the steaks and sear for 3-4 minutes on each side for
        medium-rare doneness. Adjust the cooking time based on your desired
        level of doneness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the butter, garlic, and fresh
        herbs to the skillet. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, basting the
        steaks with the garlic butter sauce. Remove the steaks from the skillet
        and let them rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing and serving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the garlic butter steaks with your favorite sides, such as roasted
        vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a fresh green salad.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enjoy your delicious homemade garlic butter steaks with a glass of red
        wine or your favorite beverage. Bon app√©tit!
